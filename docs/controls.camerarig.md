## CameraRig class

The CameraRig holds the camera, and can respond to actions such as Pan/Tilt/Dolly etc. It can also be controlled along a given path (in the form of an `AnimationClip`<!-- -->), or tweened to specified points.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class CameraRig extends EventDispatcher 
```
<b>Extends:</b> EventDispatcher

## Remarks

The rig is made of 5 objects and a camera A translation box with default name 'Translation', A rotation box with default name 'Rotation', with 3 nested objects (rotation components) - each responsible for rotation around 1 axis

The naming of 'Translation' and 'Rotation' is to ensure the rig naming matches that of an animation clip, if provided -- making it trivial to switch in and out of using an animation clip. These names can be provided in the constructor props - to match the setup of the 3d tool used to create the animation

The camera actions Pan/Tilt/Roll control the inner rotation components, not the rotation box. This allows for a seperation of a 'base' rotation if needed (for example, the animation clip only controls the rotation box, so the inner components are free to rotate anchored at this base. Similarly, moving the rig to a specific position/orientation sets the rotation of the box, leaving the components to control 3dof)

The order of rotation is dependant on the current Up axis Instead of having to remember the order, and keep track of axes visually, Each axis is labelled by a camera action - Pan, Tilt, and Roll When the Up axis is Y, for example, the Pan axis is Y, Tilt is X, and Roll is Z Similarly, this is defined for the other possible Up axes The order of rotation (and object nesting) is always Pan - Tilt - Roll

Additionaly, it can be specified if the rig should be translated along the current rotation direction any of the axes. The default is to translate along the Pan axis (Y default), ie the rig will move forward/backward in the direction the camera is panned to.

The camera actions concerned with translation are Truck/Pedestal/Dolly Again, instead of specifying x/y/z axes, Truck is translation on the Tilt axis Pedestal is translation on the Pan axis and Dolly is translation on the Roll axis

For 3dof controls, there are additional translate actions called LocalTruck / LocalPedestal / LocalDolly These will translate the inner rotation components, and perhaps should not be used when creating 6dof controls.

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)(camera, scene, props)](./controls.camerarig._constructor_.md) |  | Constructs a new instance of the <code>CameraRig</code> class |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [camera](./controls.camerarig.camera.md) |  | Camera |  |
|  [respondsToActions](./controls.camerarig.respondstoactions.md) |  | boolean |  |
|  [scene](./controls.camerarig.scene.md) |  | Scene |  |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [assemble()](./controls.camerarig.assemble.md) |  | Place the camera back in the rig |
|  [disassemble()](./controls.camerarig.disassemble.md) |  | Disassemble the camera from the rig and attach it to the scene. Useful if one needs to set the camera's world position or control it outside of the rig setup |
|  [do(action, amount)](./controls.camerarig.do.md) |  | Main method for controlling the camera |
|  [flyTo(position, quaternion, duration, ease)](./controls.camerarig.flyto.md) |  | Transition to a specific position and orientation in world space. All inner rotation components will be reset to 0 as a result of this. |
|  [flyToKeyframe(frame, duration, ease)](./controls.camerarig.flytokeyframe.md) |  | Transition to a specific keyframe on the animation clip All inner rotation components will be reset to 0 as a result of this. |
|  [freezeTransform()](./controls.camerarig.freezetransform.md) |  | Packs transfrom into parent translation and rotation elements, and 0s out transforms for all inner elements. Useful to use before procedural animation on world position and quaternion |
|  [getRotationOrder()](./controls.camerarig.getrotationorder.md) |  | Get the rotaion order as a string compatible with what three.js uses |
|  [getWorldCoordinates()](./controls.camerarig.getworldcoordinates.md) |  | Get world position and orientation of the camera |
|  [isInRig()](./controls.camerarig.isinrig.md) |  |  |
|  [isMoving()](./controls.camerarig.ismoving.md) |  | If the camera is in the middle of a transition |
|  [setAnimationClip(clip, translationObjectName, rotationObjectName)](./controls.camerarig.setanimationclip.md) |  | Set an animation clip for the rig |
|  [setAnimationKeyframe(frame)](./controls.camerarig.setanimationkeyframe.md) |  |  |
|  [setAnimationPercentage(percentage)](./controls.camerarig.setanimationpercentage.md) |  |  |
|  [setAnimationTime(time)](./controls.camerarig.setanimationtime.md) |  |  |
|  [setUpAxis(axis)](./controls.camerarig.setupaxis.md) |  | Set the Up axis for the camera, adjusting the rotation components accordingly to maintain consistent Pan/Tilt/Roll behaviour ... might not be necessary, rotationBox transforms could take care of setting context |
