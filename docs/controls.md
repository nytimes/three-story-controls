## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [BaseAdaptor](./controls.baseadaptor.md) |  |
|  [CameraRig](./controls.camerarig.md) | The CameraRig holds the camera, and can respond to actions such as Pan/Tilt/Dolly etc. It can also be controlled along a given path (in the form of an <code>AnimationClip</code>), or tweened to specified points. |
|  [Damper](./controls.damper.md) | Damper uses simple linear damping for a given collection of values. On every call to update, the damper will approach a given set of target values. |
|  [FreeMovementControls](./controls.freemovementcontrols.md) | Control scheme to move the camera with arrow/WASD keys and mouse wheel; and rotate the camera with click-and-drag events. |
|  [KeyboardAdaptor](./controls.keyboardadaptor.md) | Parse keyboard events and emit either dampened values for continuous keypresses, or trigger events named according to a provided keymapping. |
|  [PathPointsControls](./controls.pathpointscontrols.md) | Control scheme to transition the camera between specific points (frames) along a path specified through an <code>AnimationClip</code>. |
|  [PointerAdaptor](./controls.pointeradaptor.md) | Parse pointer events to emit dampened, normalized coordinates along with the pointer count (for detecting multi-touch or drag events) |
|  [ScrollAdaptor](./controls.scrolladaptor.md) | Emits normalized values for the amount a given DOM element has been scrolled through. |
|  [ScrollControls](./controls.scrollcontrols.md) | Control scheme to scrub through the CameraRig's <code>AnimationClip</code> based on the scroll of a DOM Element |
|  [StoryPointsControls](./controls.storypointscontrols.md) | Control scheme to transition the camera between given points in world space. |
|  [SwipeAdaptor](./controls.swipeadaptor.md) | Emits events in response to swipe gestures above a given threshold. |
|  [ThreeDOFControls](./controls.threedofcontrols.md) | Control scheme for slight rotation and translation movement in response to mouse movements (designed to be used in conjunction with other control schemes) |
|  [WheelAdaptor](./controls.wheeladaptor.md) | Parse mouse wheel events and emit either dampened values, or trigger events for swipes that cross a given threshold. |

## Enumerations

|  [CameraMoveStartEvent](./controls.cameramovestartevent.md) | Event: Fired when CameraRig starts a transition |
|  [CameraMoveUpdateEvent](./controls.cameramoveupdateevent.md) | Event: Fired on every tick of CameraRig's transition |
|  [ContinuousEvent](./controls.continuousevent.md) |  |
|  [DamperProps](./controls.damperprops.md) |  |
|  [DamperValues](./controls.dampervalues.md) |  |
|  [DiscreteEvent](./controls.discreteevent.md) |  |
|  [ExitPathPointsEvent](./controls.exitpathpointsevent.md) | Payload signature for event fired on user input when there is no next/prev POI to go to |
|  [ExitStoryPointsEvent](./controls.exitstorypointsevent.md) | Payload signature for event fired when nextPOI/prevPOI are invoked when at last/first POI (ie there is no POI to go to) |
|  [FreeMovementControlsProps](./controls.freemovementcontrolsprops.md) |  |
|  [IntertiaCompleteEvent](./controls.intertiacompleteevent.md) |  |
|  [KeyboardAdaptorContinuousEvent](./controls.keyboardadaptorcontinuousevent.md) | Event: Fired when a key in a <code>continuous</code> KeyboardAdaptor's mapping is pressed (<code>onKeyDown</code>) |
|  [KeyboardAdaptorDiscreteEvent](./controls.keyboardadaptordiscreteevent.md) | Event: Fired when a key in a <code>discrete</code> KeyboardAdaptor's mapping is released (<code>onKeyUp</code>) |
|  [KeyboardAdaptorProps](./controls.keyboardadaptorprops.md) |  |
|  [KeyMapping](./controls.keymapping.md) |  |
|  [PathPointMarker](./controls.pathpointmarker.md) |  |
|  [PathPointsControlsProps](./controls.pathpointscontrolsprops.md) |  |
|  [PointerAdaptorEvent](./controls.pointeradaptorevent.md) | Event: Fired when when <code>PointerEvent</code>s are triggered |
|  [PointerAdaptorProps](./controls.pointeradaptorprops.md) |  |
|  [ScrollAdaptorEvent](./controls.scrolladaptorevent.md) | Payload signature for a scroll event. Includes true and dampened values, incase real time values are needed |
|  [ScrollAdaptorProps](./controls.scrolladaptorprops.md) |  |
|  [ScrollControlsProps](./controls.scrollcontrolsprops.md) |  |
|  [ScrollPercentages](./controls.scrollpercentages.md) | Each property has a 0-1 value, representing the area that has scrolled into view. <code>head</code> is percentage the first 100vh of the scroll div, <code>foot</code> is the last 100vh, and <code>body</code> is the area in between. <code>total</code> represents the percentage scrolled of the entire div. |
|  [StoryPointMarker](./controls.storypointmarker.md) |  |
|  [StoryPointsControlsProps](./controls.storypointscontrolsprops.md) |  |
|  [SwipeAdaptorEvent](./controls.swipeadaptorevent.md) | Payload signature for a swipe event. The sign represents the direction of the swipe, y = 1 when swiping down-to-up, and x = 1 when swiping left-to-right |
|  [SwipeAdaptorProps](./controls.swipeadaptorprops.md) |  |
